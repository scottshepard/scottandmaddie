<h1>Maddie and Scott's Story</h1>

<p>
	Maddie and Scott first met at Carnegie Mellon University in the Fall of
	2009. Scott was in his freshman year and lived in Donner on the east side
	of campus. 
</p>

<p>
	Maddie lived in her Donner during her freshman year (2008-2009). In her 
	sophmore year she signed up for Donner Mentors, a program where Donner 
	upperclassmen paired with freshman to mentor them through college. Scott's
	Housefellow Hellen Wang paired the two of them as mentor and mentee. What 
	Maddie didn't know until later is that Scott specifically requested Maddie as
	his mentor because he thought she was really cute and funny.
</p>

<p>
	Scott and Maddie (Mott) became friends throughout the 2009-2010 academic year.
	They both applied to be RAs in Stever house and were accepted. They started
	dating in the Spring of 2011 on 3/14. To this day pi and pie remain a critical
	slice of their relationship.
</p>

<p>
	Scott and already been in love with Maddie for at least a year and now it was
	time for Maddie to fall in love with Scott. It's hard to say what she found 
	more attractive: his hilarious witty banter or his athletic prowess. Whatever
	it was she fell hard and soon they were a power couple on campus.
</p>

<p>
	Some of their favorite dating spots during college were Phi Bar, 
	(<a href="http://thetartan.org/2013/4/29/news/phibar">which closed this year 
</a> triggering a period of mourning on campus), Flagstaff Hill, the Natural
  Science museum, and of course, Phipps conservatory.
</p>

<p>
	After college Scott successfully convinced Maddie to move to Chicago with him
	when he got a job offer at <a href="http://esparklearning.com">
	eSpark Learning</a> where he currently works as a Data Scientist. Maddie got
	a job teaching 10th Grade Geometry at 
	<a href="http://drwcollegeprep.noblenetwork.org/">DRW Noble Charter School</a>.
	Maddie started out hating Chicago but now she loves its bitter cold winters
	and flat, pancake-esque landscape. Who needs mountains?
</p>

<p>
	Then in April of 2014 Scott and Maddie went back to campus for Carnival, CMU's
	alumni weekend where he proposed at Phipps conservatory.
