<h1>Maddie and Scott's Story</h1>

<p>
	Maddie and Scott first met at Carnegie Mellon University in the Fall of
	2009. Scott was in his freshman year and lived in Donner on the east side
	of campus. 
</p>

<p>
	Maddie lived in her Donner during her freshman year too, and in her 
	sophmore year she signed up for Donner Mentors, a program where Donner 
	upperclassmen paired with freshman to mentor them through college. Maddie
	used her feminie wiles and position of authority to seduce and corrupt Scott.
</p>

<p>
	After phase one of aquiring her target Maddie entered phase two: gaining 
	Scott's trust. She remained friendly and close thoughout the 2009-2010 school
	year and convinced Scott to apply to be an RA during his sophmore year. Scott
	and Maddie both applied and were successfully hired as RAs to Stever dorm.
</p>

<p>
	Once both Maddie and Scott got hired at Stever RAs she initiated phase 3: 
	dating. In the Spring of 2011 Maddie invited Scott on a date with her current
	boyfriend. Scott successfully 3rd wheeled, broke them up, and began dating 
	Maddie. This is after Scott tried to date Maddie's best friend, but Maddie 
	put the kibosh to that. Maddie started dating Scott slowly increasing the 
	seriousness of the relationship.
</p>

<p>
	Maddie quickly aquired status of girlfriend. She and Scott began dating in 
	earnest on 3/14/2011. Pie remains an important part of their realtionship 
	today, particularly of the pecan variety.
</p>

<p>
	Maddie and Scott dated throughout college and she fell in love with him. Some
	suspect it was his excellent frisbee skills, others are convinced it is his
  amazing physics ability. Whatever it is, she fell hopelessly in love with 
  Scott pretty quickly. They went on dates all over Pittsburgh: Eat'n Park, 
  Pamela's, Flagstaff, Pirates Games, and their favorite -- Phipps Conservatory.
</p>

<p>
	After college Maddie and Scott moved to Chicago where they are currently 
	living. Scott got a job as a Growth Hacker at <a href="http://esparklearning.com", target="_blank">
	eSpark</a> and Maddie was hired at <a href="http://drwcollegeprep.noblenetwork.org/", target="_blank">
	DRW Noble Charter school</a> teaching 10th grade geometry. Maddie loves Chicago
	and is really happy to be in the Windy City.
</p>

<p>
	Then in April of 2014 Scott and Maddie went back to campus for Carnival, CMU's
	alumni weekend.
